###About Me

A Dedan Kimathi graduate.
I am a GIS and Remote Sensing expert by profession and a web developer by passion. Technologies such as Mapbox and Google Maps have however helped me reap the best of both worlds, where I can create stunning websites while also add a spatial element to it using interactive maps.
I also write remote sensing scripts with Google Earth Engine platform.
Currently, I am working on a fullstack project that will run on drf, nuxt 3 js and of course, mapbox (nuxt-mapbox)

###What Do I Do For Fun?

I enjoy outdoor activities such as hitting the gym, swimming and going to movies with friends. This creates a balance for the time I spend indoors programming.
