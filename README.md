###About Me

A Dedan Kimathi University graduate.
Hi there! I'm a professional GIS and Remote Sensing expert with a deep love for web development. I thrive at the intersection of geospatial analysis and interactive web technologies, bringing spatial insights to life in the digital world.

ðŸš€ What I Do:

ðŸ”¥Crafting stunning websites with Mapbox and Google Maps, adding spatial elements to create immersive user experiences.
ðŸ”¥Developing remote sensing scripts with the Google Earth Engine platform to analyze and visualize environmental data.
ðŸ”¥Building robust full-stack solutions with Django Rest Framework (DRF), Nuxt 3, and Nuxt-Mapbox, leveraging my passion for web development and GIS.
ðŸ”¥Iâ€™m always excited to explore new technologies and ideas that bridge the gap between the web and geospatial insights. 

Let's create something amazing together! âœ¨

###What Do I Do For Fun?

I enjoy outdoor activities such as hitting the gym, swimming and going to movies with friends. This creates a balance for the time I spend indoors programming.
